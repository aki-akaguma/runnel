Based on the analysis of the source code and `Cargo.toml`, here are the requirements for the `runnel` library:

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Pluggable I/O Streams:** The central concept of `runnel` is to provide a flexible and extensible way to handle I/O operations. It achieves this by defining a set of traits for input, output, and error streams (`StreamIn`, `StreamOut`, `StreamErr`).
*   **Thin Interface:** The library aims to provide a minimal and easy-to-use API, as evidenced by the simple `lock()` method for accessing the underlying stream and the straightforward `read`, `write`, and `flush` operations.
*   **Testability:** A key feature is the ability to easily test code that performs I/O. The `stringio` module allows for in-memory string-based streams, which can be used to simulate user input and capture output for verification in tests.
*   **Concurrency Support:** The `pipeio` module enables communication between threads using in-memory pipes, making it suitable for concurrent applications.

**Stream Types:**

The library provides several implementations of the core stream traits:

*   **`stdio`:** Wraps the standard input, output, and error streams of the operating system (`std::io::stdin`, `std::io::stdout`, `std::io::stderr`). This is the default stream type.
*   **`stringio`:** Provides in-memory string-based streams (`StringIn`, `StringOut`, `StringErr`). This is particularly useful for testing purposes, as it allows you to provide input to and capture output from your code without interacting with the actual console.
*   **`pipeio`:** Implements in-memory pipes (`PipeIn`, `PipeOut`, `PipeErr`) for thread-safe, first-in, first-out (FIFO) communication between different parts of an application.
*   **`lineio`:** (Currently under planning) This module is intended to provide line-buffered I/O for more efficient line-by-line processing.

**Key Data Structures:**

*   **`RunnelIoe`:** A struct that bundles together the input, output, and error streams (`pin`, `pout`, `perr`).
*   **`RunnelIoeBuilder`:** A builder pattern for creating `RunnelIoe` instances. It allows you to easily configure the desired stream types (e.g., `stdio`, `stringio`, `pipeio`) for each of the I/O channels.

**Dependencies:**

*   The library has no external dependencies listed in its `Cargo.toml`. It relies only on the Rust standard library.

**Supported Rust Version:**

*   The minimum supported Rust version is 1.56.0.
